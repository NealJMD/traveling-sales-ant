# The Traveling Sales-ant - December 2012

This is my solution to the jobs challenge for Zillabyte, a small Palo Alto based startup. Zillabyte ultimately ended the interview process early when they decided they were not in a position to hire a full-time paid intern at that time, but I got to do this fun challenge. The objective is to implement a solution to the traveling salesman problem in javascript. 

I did both a trivial solution (quick_salesman.js) that works well and quickly, and a much more complicated learning solution (ant_salesman.js) that simulates a colony of ants running around the graph laying pheromones, based on the paper included as ant-tsp.pdf. The ant one is slow and doesn't work that well but it's really cool. The algorithm is taken from a 1996 paper from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles which is included as ant-tsp.pdf.

## The Details

 I chose to give two solutions to the TSP challenge on the website. First there's a simple and trivial solution that meets all the design constraints - it beats the given baseline by about 30% and it takes no longer to run. I simply updated the get_closest_unvisited_point() method to first check if any of the  surrounding points is unvisited, and if there are any to return the closest one. It is only if this fails that it searches the entire graph for the geographically closest unvisited point. The natural extension  would be to do a proper greedy search for the closest unvisited point using distance-along-edges instead  of geographic distance as the metric. It would be straightforward to keep track of the length of the  shortest path to reach each node. However, I chose instead to spend my energy on my second solution.

 My second solution is an implementation of the coolest algorithm I found while researching TSP online.  The idea is to simulate a colony of ants walking through the graph. Each ant moves probabilistically from node to node, favoring the edges with a stronger pheromone signal. After each round, the ant which found the shortest path lays down an amount of pheromone on the path inversely proportional to the length of the path. The algorithm is described at length at Dorigo 1996 (ant-tsp.pdf)

 My implementation adds about 170 lines of code to the file (with liberal comments). It takes a long time to run (well beyond the time limit) and beats the baseline by less than the trivial solution. However, I think it's an extremely interesting approach to the problem and I'm confident that my implementation could be groomed to be near-optimal. There are two factors holding it back, both of which could be solved with more work. 

 First is simply the problem of running time. This stochastic approach must walk the graph many times to learn  anything useful so it is slower than the baseline by a large constant factor. I have not had the opportunity to run  it with a large number of ants making a large number of walks. Based on the wide variance of the path-length  performance of AntSalesman I believe it's simply not getting enough data to converge on a consistent path.

 Second is the issue of parameters. The ants'  decision-making process is influenced by 4 parameters which are set as constants at the beginning of the compute function. The paper from which I was working gave no guidance as to how to set them so I was left guessing. I  ran some informal tests to find decent settings, but if I were to continue to work with this I would automatically run tests changing all 4 independent variables one at a time and find the point in the 5 dimensional surface that minimizes the path length.
